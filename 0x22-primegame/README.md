# Prime game

### Description
Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers
starting from 1 up to and including n, take turns choosing a prime
number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from
set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

They play x rounds, where n may be different for each round
Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally,
determine who the winner of each game is.
